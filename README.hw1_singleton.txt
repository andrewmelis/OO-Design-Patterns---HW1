HW1 - Problem 1: Singleton Pattern

I've written the Singleton problem in ruby -- it is included as "singleton.rb".

Simply type, "ruby singleton.rb" to run.

I've commented heavily within the file.
The top half defines classes, and the bottom half tests functionality.
I've laid out the testing section exactly as described in the assignment document.
